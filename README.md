# 👋 Hi there, I'm Laura Haro Escoi!

🎓 I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Lleida.

💡 I love participating in hackathons to improve my programming skills and learn new technologies.

🌟 Currently, I work as a Full-Stack Developer:

- 🚀 Deploying applications on a server using Docker and Docker Compose.
- 🔍 Utilizing Google APIs.
- 🖥️ Backend development with Node.js and Python (FastAPI).
- 🌐 Frontend development with Angular and Ionic.

📌 On my profile, you can find some of the projects I've developed during hackathons pinned at the top. Feel free to check them out on my Devpost porfolio too! [[Devpost](https://devpost.com/lauraharoescoi?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav)].
